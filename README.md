# Fruit Classifier with PyTorch!
Going back to visit my family after a long time of not being in Costa Rica. Fruits were maturing slowly over the weeks I was there. Decided to take pictures and use a pretrained ResNet CNN with PyTorch for doing image classification. Importantly, the **azureml branch** shows how to make the code work using Azure Machine Learning SDK v2, developed this while studying for Azure DP 100 certification. 

### Objective

Classify different types of fruits with only few images using a pretrained ResNet. The **azureml branch** can be useful to explore Azure Machine Learning further.

### Requirements
Use conda to create an environment in which you can install the requirements.txt file.
